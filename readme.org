* sudoku-purescript

This is a sudoku solver with a minimal UI on top. The solver logic is a translation of Richard Bird's implementation in [[https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/thinking-functionally-with-haskell/79F91D976F0C7229082325B41824EBBC#][Thinking Functionally with Haskell]]. A clojure version is [[https://github.com/sunflowerseastar/sudoku-clojure][here]].
